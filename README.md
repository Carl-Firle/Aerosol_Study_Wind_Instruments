Directory `data` contains `Particle Counts` of each subject during the different tasks and the emission rates from all subjects `
EmissionRates_wind instruments.xlsx`. `Description` of `data` includes the principles of aerosol emission rate calculations and a translation table.

Directory `fig` contains different figures:
- Correlation Plots for task, height, weight and emission rates 
- 3-D figure of probe cabin
- Histograms for aerosol particle sizes from different tasks
- Plots for particle counts (time resolution and count event)
- Task Plots for emission rates

Directory `pic` contains further pictures of experimental setup.

Directory `Risk Assessment/fig` contains output plots from the three risk assessment situations with respect to Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants.
