# Data and figures concerning "Aerosol emission rates playing wind instruments â€“ implementation within the assessment of Covid-19 infection risk"

The file `Data processing illustrated.pdf` in main directory shows the principles of aerosol emission rate calculations.

Directory `data` contains `Particle Counts` of each proband during the different tasks and the emission rates from all subjects `
EmissionRates_wind instruments.xlsx`.

Directory `fig` contains different figures:
- Correlation Plots for task, height, weight and emission rates 
- 3-D figure of probe cabin
- Histograms for aerosol particle sizes from different tasks
- Plots for particle counts (time resolution and count event)
- Task Plots for emission rates

Directory `pic` contains further pictures of the experimental setup.

Directory `Risk Assessment/fig` contains output plots from the three risk assessment situations with respect to Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants.
