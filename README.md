# Data and figures related to "Aerosol emission rates playing wind instruments â€“ implementation within the assessment of Covid-19 infection risk"

The file `Data processing illustrated.pdf` in the main directory explains the approach to aerosol emission rate calculations.

Directory `data` contains `Particle Counts` of each proband during the various tasks and the calculated emission rates (`EmissionRates_wind instruments.xlsx`).

Directory `fig` contains different figures:
- Correlation plots for tasks, body height and weight, and emission rates
- 3D-figure of the probe cabin
- Histograms for aerosol particle sizes from different tasks
- Plots of particle counts over time, differentiating the events
- Emission rates for various tasks

Directory `pic` contains photographs of the experimental setup.

Directory `Risk Assessment/fig` contains plots of the three risk-assessment cases, divided by the Alpha and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2.
