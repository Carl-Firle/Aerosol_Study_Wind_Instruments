# Description of image stacks (`.tif`)
Slide 1 of each image stack in a TIFF file shows all measurement quantities in the course of time: Water amount in probe cabin, aerosol particle concentration (d p <= 6.6 µm), air velocity from anemometer. The aerosol particle concentration plots show a confidence range of ± 1 standard deviation. The line colors indicate the aerosol spectrometer position: magenta = 50 cm, cyan = 150 cm, yellow = 300 cm. The box colors indicate the tasks: red = instrument playing, light red = instrument playing with mask protection, green = speaking, light green = speaking with a surgical mask, blue = breathing. Light grey bars below the concentration plots indicate presence of the proband in the probe cabin, dark grey bars indicate the probe cabin being open. Chevron bars indicate running fan, zigzag bars indicate running air cleaner.
Slides 2 - 11 of each image stack in a TIFF file show counts of aerosol particles over time during the different tasks, as returned by the three aerosol spectrometers. All count values have standard deviations visualized by error bars. See `Aerosol_Study_Wind_Instruments/data/Description.md` for detailed information. Orange lines show linear regression of the count values.
Slide 12 is redundant.
