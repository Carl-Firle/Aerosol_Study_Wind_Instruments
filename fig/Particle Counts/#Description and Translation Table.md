# Description of Image Stacks
Slide 1 of the Image Stack in Tif-file shows complete measurement gradients: water amount in probe cabin, aerosol particles concentration (d<sub> p </sub> <= 6.6 µm), air flow from anemometer. Units are included. 
The  line graphs of aerosol particle concentration has a confidence zone of sigma (standard deviation). The colors of line graphs refer to the aerosol spectrometers position: `pink = 50 cm, turquois = 150 cm, yellow = 300 cm`. The color of the boxes refers to the task: `red = instrument playing, light red = instrument playing with mask protection, green = speaking, light green = speaking with a surgical mask, blue = breathing`. First `light grey block` bellow indicates `proband in the probe cabin`, followed by `grey block = opened probe cabin`. `Grey grid` indicates `fan` in use. `Zigzag symbol` indicaltes `air cleaner` in use.
