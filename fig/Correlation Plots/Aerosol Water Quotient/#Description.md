# Correlation Plot of Particle per Water Quotient

Particle per Water Quotients (unit: particles/mg water) are displayed for the different tasks. The centre point of the ellipse indicates the emission quotients from one task on the ordinate and from the other task on the abscissa. The semiaxes of the ellipse indicate the standard deviations for each task, according to bootstrap estimation. The grey line indicates equal emission quotients at both tasks. Ellipses above that line indicate higher emission quotients from the task on the ordinate.
