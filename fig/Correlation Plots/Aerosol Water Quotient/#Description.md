# Correlation plots of particles per water ratio

Particles per water ratios (unit: particles/mg water) are displayed for the various tasks. The center point of the ellipse indicates the emission quotients from one task on the ordinate and from the other task on the abscissa. The semiaxes of the ellipse indicate the standard deviations for each task, according to bootstrap estimation. The grey line indicates equal emission quotients during both tasks. Ellipses above that line indicate higher emission quotients from the task on the ordinate.
