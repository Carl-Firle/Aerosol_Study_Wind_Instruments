# Correlation Plot of Aerosol Emission Rates

Aerosol emission rates (unit: particles/s) are displayed for the different tasks. The centre point of the ellipse indicates the emission rate from one task on the ordinate and from the other task on the abscissa. The semiaxes of the ellipse indicate the standard deviations for each task, according to bootstrap estimation. The grey line indicates equal emission rates at both tasks. Ellipses above that line indicate higher emission rates from the task on the ordinate.
